# SharePoint & Nintex Scripts

This is a repository of misc scripts and code snippets used in SharePoint and Nintex we don't want to lose. 
You're welcome to copy and use them, but few will make sense out of context.

Disclaimer:
We provide no guarantee of any kind that these scripts will be kept up to date, nor do we guarantee support of any kind to make them work in any environment other than our own.
